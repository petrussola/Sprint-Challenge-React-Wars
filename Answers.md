1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS is a Js library that allows devs to build app faster by makeing the UI more flexible. For instance, it introduces the concept of components, pieces of code that define an element of the page and that connected to places in the App where they are needed. This makes updating data seamless because, no matter how many times you request such an element, it pulls from the same source, making updating data across your app very easy.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

It mainly means thinking in components, pieces of UI that are defined once and can be reused as many times in your app as you wish.

1. Describe state.

State is a variable that is used to keep track of data. It has an initial state and can be updated any time through means of a setter function. Both are native to react.

1. Describe props.

Props, short for properties, is data that is passed from the parent element down to children element and that is used to build components.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects is code to run arbitrary code inside our components. An examples of this is fetching data from an API. They are fired with the native React `useEffect` tool.
